<!-- Summary -->
<h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Summary</h3>
<p>
   We are going to implement a causal profiler for parallel Java programs.
   We will test the profiler on a few widely used libraries and attempt to optimize those libraries with our results.
</p>

<!-- Background -->
<h3><a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>
<p>
    We are going to implement a Java version of the <a href="https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz" target="_blank">Coz profiler</a> that was presented at SOSP 2015
    and awarded best paper. The profiler works by randomly selecting lines in a program, freezing all other threads for a randomly
    chosen period of time while the current threads run, and measuring the virtual speedup of the program relative to <i>progress points</i> chosen by the programmer,
    or end to end runtime of the program. We have chosen to implement the project for Java because it has already been written for C/C++ by the authors of the original
    paper linked above. In addition, a huge portion of the business software market is written in Java, and this could potentially be a valuable tool with deep market
    reach if successful.
</p>

<p>
    We feel that this new approach to profiling is very vauable for measuring parallel programs. Current profilers simply measure the time spent in a given function,
    and the number of times that function is called. This fails to measure subtleties of how optimizations can imporve or harm parallel program runtimes. Take the following
    example (taken from <a href="https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz/raw/master/Coz-Curtsinger-Berger-SOSP2015.pdf" target="_blank">https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz/raw/master/Coz-Curtsinger-Berger-SOSP2015.pdf</a>):
    <tt>
        <br />void a() {<br />
        &emsp;for(volatile size_t x = 0; x < 20000000000; x++) {} <br />
        }<br />
        void b() {<br />
        &emsp;for(volatile size_t x = 0; x < 19000000000; x++) {}<br />
        }<br />
        <br />
        int main() {<br />
        &emsp;thread thread_a(a), thread_b(b);<br />
        &emsp;thread_a.join(); thread_b.join();<br />
        }<br />
    </tt><br />

    A normal profiler such as <tt>gprof</tt> might indicate that we spent 55% of the time in <tt>a()</tt>, and 45% of the runtime in <tt>b()</tt>. However,
    we know that speeding up <tt>b()</tt> would result in no speedup on a 2+ core machine. A causal profiler would reveal this, because a virtual speedup of <tt>b()</tt>
    wouldn't result in an overall speedup of the program. In addition, the ease of understanding the output of a causal profiler is valuable.
    While some profilers (i.e. <tt>perf</tt> showing how many cache misses occur) would attempt to indicate how to fix a problem,
    a causal profiler simply tells you where you should focus your development effort to achieve maximum speedup.
</p>

<!-- The Challenge -->
<h3><a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Challenge</h3>
<p>
    Though the causal approach to profiling is elegant and surprisingly simple, we will be interacting with the JVM at a level that requires understanding of how the
    JVM works, how to freeze and resume threads, and how to map progress points to source code. In addition, though at a high level causal profiling is rather simple,
    there are technical subtleties that will require substantial planning and careful design. For example, it is important to choose source lines to virtually
    speed-up uniformly at random to avoid introducing bias into the profiler. Also, I/O introduces quite a bit of complexity, as we still want to have threads that
    are waiting on I/O be frozen when they return from that I/O to achieve accurate virtual speedup. This will likely be a stretch goal, but subtleties such as these
    occur quite frequently in causal profiling and it may prove challenging to design a profiler that addresses them well.

<p>
    We will perform development on a Unix system in C++. Java provides a robust API for interacting with the JVM (the Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface), which we
    will utilize heavily in our development. Though our codebase will be starting from scratch, the design of our project will follow from the codebase written
    by the paper authors for C/C++. In addition, we will be implementing the profiler described in the paper, so it will be a guide when designing and building
    our project.
</p>
<p>
    We have considered testing our profiler on a variety of different machines when we attempt to optimize well known Java libraries, so having access to latedays,
    or other high performance / multicore / multi-CPU / etc machines may prove useful during this testing phase.

<!-- Goals and Deliverables -->
<h3><a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals and Deliverables</h3>

<p>
    <h4>Plan to Achieve</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>A working causal profiler with end to end latency metrics (without handling disc or network I/O)</li>
        <li>Add ability to mark progress points for measuring program throughput with finer granularity</li>
        <li>Profile some well known Java libraries (tbd)</li>
    </ol>
    We believe that we can achieve the above goals because the above features have been implemented in the original version of Coz in C++, so we believe that
    it should be possible to implement them for Java as well. In addition, we have done some exploration of the JVMTI API, and we believe that it is should provide
    the interface necessary to implement our profiler.

    <h4>Hope to Achieve</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>After profiling Java libraries, optimize those libraries and demonstrate results</li>
        <li>Add latency measurement feature</li>
        <li>Add I/O handling</li>
    </ol>
    Here are some Java libraries, some of which we are considering optimizing:

        <li><a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_blank">Tomcat</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/" target="_blank">JAMA (a Java Matrix package)</a></li>

    </ul>
    And here is a link to <a href="https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?language" target="_blank">more Apache projects</a>
    <br /><br />

    <h4>Parallelism Competition</h4>
    We will demonstrate the results of running our profiler on toy problems to indicate the basic features of the profiler.
    If we are able to optimize well known Java libraries, we will explain our optimizations, 
    how JCoz helped us to locate those optimizations, and illustrate the differences in runtime.
</p>

<!-- Platform choice -->
<h3><a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Platform Choice</h3>
<p>
    Multicore Unix systems are an appropriate platform for this project. We hope to test our code on a variety of hardware platforms, including
    personal computers and high performance machines. It makes sense to test using a variety of systems to validate our project idea.
</p>
